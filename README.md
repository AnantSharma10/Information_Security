This repository contains various Java programs to perform cryptographic encryption and decryption, as well as some mathematical calculations. Each program has been designed to solve specific problems related to cryptography and number theory. Below is a description of each program.

                                                            List of Programs
Multiplicative Inverse
  --This program calculates the multiplicative inverse of n numbers modulo a given integer. Useful for cryptographic calculations involving modular arithmetic.

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
  --This program finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using an efficient algorithm (e.g., Euclidean algorithm). GCD is fundamental in number theory and cryptography.

Residue Class
  --This program demonstrates a residue class operation, calculating the remainder when dividing a number by a given modulus. It's commonly used in modular arithmetic applications.

Caesar Cipher
  --This program performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique. In this method, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places in the alphabet, based on a key.

Playfair Cipher
  --This program implements the Playfair Cipher, an encryption technique that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters based on a keyword. It encrypts pairs of letters for added security over simple substitution ciphers.

Matrix Operations
  --This program calculates the determinant, cofactor, transpose, adjoint, and inverse of a given matrix. Essential for linear algebra computations and certain cryptographic algorithms.

Hill Cipher
  --This program encrypts and decrypts plaintext using the Hill Cipher, which is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra and matrix multiplication.

Rail Fence Cipher
  --This program implements the Rail Fence Cipher, a form of transposition cipher where the plaintext is written in a zigzag pattern across multiple rows, then read off row by row.

Transposition Cipher
  --This program uses a transposition cipher to encrypt and decrypt text by rearranging the characters according to a specified system.

P-box Cipher
  --This program demonstrates encryption and decryption using a P-box (permutation box) method, which rearranges bits or characters within a block to provide diffusion in the cipher.

S-box Cipher
  --This program implements an S-box (substitution box) for encryption, which substitutes input bits with output bits. It's commonly used in modern cryptographic systems to increase non-linearity.

Feistel Cipher
  --This program encrypts and decrypts using a Feistel Cipher, a symmetric structure used in many block ciphers like DES. It divides data into halves and applies multiple rounds of encryption operations.
